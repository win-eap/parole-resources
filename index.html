The PCAP staff work with women who are currently pregnant or 6 months post-partum and are at risk of delivering a child exposed to drugs and/or alcohol. The PCAP advocates will work with the women for up to 3 years in a mentorship role and will never ask the women to leave the program, no matter the outcome of the pregnancy.<br />
<br />
The FASD Adult Advocate works with individuals who have or who may have FASD to assist in the creation of routine and stability. The FASD Adult Advocate provides extensive role-modelling and practical assistance and connects participants to a comprehensive variety of services in the community.</li>

    <li><span>Program name</span>: Friendly Calls</li>
    <li><span>Short program description</span>: The Friendly Calls program in Alberta offers phone call support and community referral assistance to people aged 55 and older. Through phone conversations with trained Red Cross volunteers, participants in this free program receive information, resources, and community referrals, as needed, from the comfort and safety of their own homes.
The Canadian Red Cross Friendly Calls program helps address issues of isolation and loneliness which have become heightened during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The program pairs a trained Red Cross volunteer or staff member with an adult who is feeling isolated or lonely, who may have limited social and family connections, or who feels they could benefit from more social interaction. 
At a regularly scheduled time, Red Cross personnel call the people with whom they are paired for a social chat, connecting them, if needed, with resources available in their community.</li>

Who It’s For<br />
Indigenous women (trans-inclusive) who have experienced sexual abuse and/or assault, as children or as adults.<br />
<br />
Description<br />
This closed therapeutic group for Indigenous women works to create a safe space to give voice to experiences of sexual abuse or assault, and to feel validated by the experiences of others in their communities. The group was developed in recognition that the experiences of Indigenous women are unique, and processing trauma from sexual assault or abuse needs to involve education about the bigger picture of colonialism and its inter-relationship with sexual violence.<br />
<br />
The group’s format includes exposure or introduction to traditional teachings and ceremony, as well as education about trauma and its effect on the brain and body. It also covers skills to self-regulate triggers, and aims to reduce shame, and build self-confidence and self-esteem.<br />
<br />
The program commences with an in-house pipe ceremony, and ends with an optional sweat. The group is co-facilitated by an Elder (Kookum) and an Indigenous psychologist/therapist.<br />
<br />
Each session begins with a smudge and prayer, and includes an educational component and cultural teaching. A healthy hot meal is provided. In line with the holistic teachings of the four aspects of self, each session and the whole group itself are structured in a way that honours this view of healing.<br />
<br />
The four phases of the group are:<br />
<br />
Physical: Preparing<br />
<br />
Pipe ceremony, introductions &amp; creating safe space<br />
Self-sovereignty &amp; self-care<br />
Mental: Learning<br />

If a crisis does arise, then members of the public can take action that may reduce the harm that could result.</li>

Psychoeducation will also show you that others have walked this path before you. It will help you understand what people who have experienced sexual violence usually experience, and what kind of tools and supports are most effective.</li>

    <li><span>Details of support</span>: - Skills for Change - Runs once per week for 4 weeks<br />
<br />
Skills for Change is a closed psychoeducation group requiring registration. It is offered to adult individuals of any gender who are on the waitlist for counselling services at SACE, and may be accessed without having worked with a counsellor in the past.<br />
<br />
Individuals on the waitlist for individual counselling have the choice if they would like to participate in this group, and choosing not to register does not disqualify someone from accessing individual counselling services. Similarly, participating in Skills for Change does not mean that an individual is required to continue on to individual counselling if their circumstances change and they are no longer interested in individual counselling. Participants are screened prior to accessing this group: clients presenting with psychosis, active and ongoing addiction, and/or significant suicidality are not recommended for this group, and instead the information from Skills for Change is offered in individual counselling.<br />

    <li><span>Short program description</span>: Psychological First Aid (PFA) is about taking care of yourself – your thoughts, feelings and emotions when you have experienced stress, crisis or trauma – and then being there for family, friends and community when they are having difficulty coping.

Learn how to anticipate stress and crisis whenever possible and equip yourself with the skillset to practice self-care and to provide care for others during particularly challenging times. Unlike mental health first aid, which trains people to help someone during a mental health emergency, Red Cross Psychological First Aid teaches you how to build up resiliency to stress and establish coping strategies for stress and trauma.</li>
